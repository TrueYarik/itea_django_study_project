Project description
---
My  simple project on Django, which I step-by-step develop as studied at ITEA.  
Project consists of two simple forms to add student or teacher data into database.  
Also it has main page with two links leading to these forms.  
If all form's fields filled correctly, data will right away will be committed into the database, otherwise in top of respective field will appear validation error with a message of how to change input to let it further be processed.  
Form functionality as well as validation functions are covered up with unit-tests.
